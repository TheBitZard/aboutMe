Hey!

My name is Daniel, I am 24 years old and currently studying Petroleum Engineering at the University of Leoben in Styria, Austria.

In my spare time I have taught myself Python, Java, JavaScript and C# and have a general understanding of how to use them.

Currently I'm very interested in web-development and I'm working hard on my skills in HTML and CSS and hope to be confident enough to publish my first website soon.
